## Modder Guide

Shows how a modder can upload his mods sourcefile (en).

### 1. Inviting the Bot

Inviting the Bot to your server or joining a discord server that has the bot already.

Invite link: [Invite bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=949725454477168661&permissions=140123630656&scope=applications.commands%20bot)

Link to a discord server that has the command: [VSWorks](https://discord.gg/7z5mxQN3sm)

### 2. Uploading sourcefiles

Rename your en.json file to contain your modid and modauthor name.

From `en.json` to `Modname-Author.json`

Example

`Backpackpackstandard-Mr1k3.json`

Now its time to use the first command on the bot.

Open discord and use a textchannel of your choice. (most servers have dedicated channels for bot commands)

The command you want to use for uploading a file is called `!addfile`

Enter `!addfile` and click on the `+` to the left.

Now select your renamed language file `Modname-Author.json` and send your message.

Nice now your sourcefile is on the project and can be translated by anyone.
