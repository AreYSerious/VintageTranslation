## General

The source files on the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/vintage-story-mods) are getting updated daily.
That means the `en.json` files from the latest released or updated mods are getting pulled from the official [Moddb](https://mods.vintagestory.at/).
So the next time you update or release your mod they will get uploaded automatically.

The translated files can be grabbed by mod authors from this [Dropbox page](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/q7u3idxz3edsytki8n6m4/h?dl=0&rlkey=mc3xn22a49qwrjp5cmx1he0ay). (The up-to-date translations are being updated daily as well. No LIVE updates)

Manual uploads or updates are still possible with the Discord bot. More on that later.

### Uploading translations

If your mod has already translated files you need to manually add them to the crowdin project.

The following Tutorial shows how that can be done:

### Downloading translations

If you want to update your mod and want to use the uptodate translations head over to this [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/q7u3idxz3edsytki8n6m4/h?dl=0&rlkey=mc3xn22a49qwrjp5cmx1he0ay).
You can download the translated files for each mod.

### Restrictions

- manual one time uploading of already translated files via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/vintage-story-mods) for modauthors.
- only `en.json` files from the modid folder are being uploaded. Example: `\assets\modid\lang\en.json` **NOT** `\assets\game\lang\en.json`
- the `en.json` file has to be correct [Json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) syntax. **NOT** [Json5](https://json5.org/) which the game supports but not Crowdin.
- Daily updates no LIVE updates.
